# Overview
This mod adds new features as well as many customization options to the in-game photo camera.

### Options
+ **Save Photos**: After taking a photo you can use a customizable hotkey to save it to your PC.
+ **Photo FOV Adjustment**: Allows to adjust the FOV multiplier of taken photos.
+ **Camera Clip Size**: Allows to adjust the camera's 'clip' size so that it can store more film at a time without reloading.
+ **Instant Photos**: Allows to immediately take photos one after another without waiting through the animation of taking out the picture. (This will lead to animation desync but is fully functional).
+ **Film Unloading**: Allows to unload film from the camera in the inventory. (Enabled by default).

Photos get saved in a special SavedPhotos folder inside your mod folder.
